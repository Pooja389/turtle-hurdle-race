# Turtle Hurdle Race Game

This is a simple game built using Python's `turtle` module where a player controls a turtle to dodge randomly generated hurdles. The goal is to avoid hitting the hurdles while racing upwards. The player moves the turtle using the arrow keys and attempts to reach the top without colliding with any obstacles.

## Features
- **Player Control**: The player controls the turtle's movement using the up arrow key.
- **Hurdles**: Random hurdles appear and move towards the player. The player must avoid these obstacles.
- **Game End Conditions**: The game ends if the player collides with a hurdle or reaches the top.

## How to Play

2. Use the **Up arrow key** to move the turtle upwards.
3. Avoid the hurdles as they appear on the screen.
